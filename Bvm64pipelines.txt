Consolidated pipelines for Bvm64 data analysis.

This document offers details on the analyses conducted, but scripts are not intended to be
used as is to perform analyses in another system.  System dependencies would necessitate
many changes to the code here in order to adapt the pipeline.  This is a "lab notebook" 
made public so that the methods can be scrutinized and the experiment might be re-created
elsewhere, with some effort.  It is not a software distribution.
